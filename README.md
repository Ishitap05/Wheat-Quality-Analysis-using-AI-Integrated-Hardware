# Wheat-Quality-Analysis-using-AI-Integrated-Hardware
## Wheat Quality Analysis Device 

An embedded AI-based system for real-time, image-based wheat quality assessment, developed as a scalable and field-deployable hardware-software solution.

---

##  Project Overview

This project aims to automate and streamline the process of evaluating wheat grain quality using a dual Raspberry Pi setup and machine learning models. Developed under the mentorship of **Prof. Tushar Sandhan** at **IIT Kanpur**, the system integrates **hardware control, AI inference**, and **user interaction** to provide **non-invasive, real-time** quality metrics for the agricultural domain.
